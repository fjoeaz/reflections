When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Usually because with a remote repository:
		your files are backed up on another computer allowing for fault protection.
		you can share your work more readily
		others can easily fork or clone your work
		you can work on your work from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Just use fetch instead of pull and any issues you might have had will be resolved. This way your local repository is always up-to-date but you will not have to worry about merge conflicts until you are ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork the same thing as a clone except you own the permissions on the master branch and push is not tied to the old remote.
	Clone is a way to pull down an exact copy of a repo with ties to the repo you cloned.
	Branches are commits tagged with a name.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can make changes to it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I would collaborate the same way that I have in the past with another versioning system another website.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
	When the task you are trying to accomplish makes sense to do it in a branch. This is all personal preference really.
What benefits does each approach have?
	It is another layer of complexity if it will help complete the task it can be a good thing.
